For what has become a new winter holiday tradition, the Naev DevTeam is proud
to announce the release of version 0.10.0.
This release contains many incredible new features, significantly improved and
expanded old features, and tons of new content including multiple long
campaigns.
The 0.10.0 implements many of the major wanted features for Naev and will
likely allow the next releases to focus much more on polish, filling out the
existing universe, and more exciting new content.
We would like to thank all the contributors who have participated and helped in
the making of this release.

Most notable changes:

* Plugin system implemented
* Player fleets
* Hypergates
* Asteroids completely reworked
* More space anomalies
* True bioships
* Tons of new content
