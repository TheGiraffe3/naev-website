Naev is now available as a Native Apple Silicon app!

Starting with 0.11.2, any versions of Naev released in the future will include
native support for Apple Silicon. Nightly releases are included. This should
benefit users that have an Apple device with Apple Silicon (M1, M2, etc.), with
significant speedups compared to running Naev with Rosetta. For running Apple
Silicon builds of Naev make sure you are running macOS 11.0 or higher. Users with
Intel Macs can still run Naev on macOS 10.13 or higher.

Enjoy!

You can get this new version from any of the following sources:
