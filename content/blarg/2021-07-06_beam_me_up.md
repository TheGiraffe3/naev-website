*This post is about development on Naev 0.9.0.*

So fact is, beams are cool. They can hit multiple targets and do a lot of damage while being accurate. Sure they have short range and bad tracking, but they more than make up for that in coolness factor. We thought about it and decided the only way to make beams cooler is to sprinkle some shader goodness ontop. Not only will this make beams look great at any resolution, but it will also allow creating new beams easily, as there is no longer a need to muck around with graphic images.

Below is a showcase of the beam animations.

How do they look in-game? Well even better, but you'll have to see for yourself!
