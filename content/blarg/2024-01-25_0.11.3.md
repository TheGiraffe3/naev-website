blurb: The Naev DevTeam is proud to announce the release of Naev version 0.11.3.

This new version hopefully fixes the bug that causes autonav to crash the game
in specific conditions, fixes autonav breaking when loading old saves, and
increases the yields of mining five-fold. Other minor bug fixes and translation
updates are included in the update.  Thanks to all those reported and involved
in the fixing!
