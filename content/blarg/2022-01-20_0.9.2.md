The Naev DevTeam is satisfied to announce the release of Naev version 0.9.2. This
release addresses minor issues and bugs from the 0.9.1 release and does not add
any new content. It is highly recommended to update from 0.9.1 as soon as possible.

Although it has been heavily tested, there are almost certainly still bugs
around, please report any issues on [this
tracker](https://github.com/naev/naev/issues), and feel free to join our
Discord or Matrix ([chat rooms](https://naev.org/contact/)).
