blurb: The Naev DevTeam is proud to announce the release of Naev version 0.11.5.

This is a minor release, that mainly provides build support for BSD systems.
However, an important issue where the combat hologram projector could make
escorts hostile and some missing jumps in the FLF-Pirate map have also been
fixed.

If you are interested on helping the Naev project, you can get in contact with
other players and developers from the [contact page](<%=@config[:author_uri]+"/contact/"%>).
