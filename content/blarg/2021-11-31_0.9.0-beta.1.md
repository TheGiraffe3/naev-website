title: Naev 0.9.0-beta.1
author: bobbens
tags: [ 'release' ]

It's been a very productive year. With almost 8,500 commits from 0.8.2. For
reference, this is roughly one third of all the commits in the entire Naev
source code have been done this last year. As you can guess, with so many
changes altering fundamental things including most of the core gameplay
mechanics, there is a high chance that many things have been broken and things
lack polish. For this reason, like with the 0.8.x releases, we are going to do
several betas as we near the final 0.9.0 release, which we hope to be able to
get out this year. Of course, this will depend on how many bugs and issues are
found.

If you try it and find any issues, please report them at [the issue
tracker](https://github.com/naev/naev/issues). Discussion about the game can be
had on Discord ([discord invite](https://discord.com/invite/nd2M5BR)).
