Over the past few weeks we have been experimenting with bridging our Discord community to Matrix; an open network for secure, decentralized communication. Please note that Discord will continue working as normally.

### Why would we do this?
The answer to that is two-fold:

Matrix, by design is decentralised, which means anyone can host their own server and have control over their data. For some people this may be the reason they refuse to use Discord entirely. 

If something bad happens to Discord we will have some record of the discussions that have been had since these two networks have been bridged, and have an alternative place to discuss Naev.

### What do you mean by 'bridging'?
To cater to individuals who dislike Discord and to increase our presence online we decided to create a Matrix community and bridge it to our Discord. This means that any messages sent on either platform will be synchronized between the two. This includes edits, mentions, and more.

### What is this Matrix thingy?
