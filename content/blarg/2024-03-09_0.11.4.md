blurb: The Naev DevTeam is proud to announce the release of Naev version 0.11.4.
---

This new version contains a diversity of fixes, including a rcash when selling
deployed ships, and some issues that still appeared on some platforms when
using autonav. We are also glad to announce that this version includes two
complete translations: Japanese and Spanish. Most of the outstanding issues
have been resolved and we hope that this is the last release in the 0.11.x
series.
