blurb: Naev 0.11.0-beta.3 is released!
---

During playtesting 0.11.0-beta.2, we've found even more issues that have been
fixed, including some hard crashes and some inconsistencies with weapon set
behaviours. Additionally, lots more quality of life usability such as in range
weapon sets only shooting when enemies are in arcs have also been added. We're
hoping this to be the last beta before the official release which should hit in
a week or so. As always, please report any issues on [this
tracker](https://github.com/naev/naev/issues), and feel free to join our
Discord or Matrix chatrooms. Find out more about them
[here!](https://naev.org/contact/)
