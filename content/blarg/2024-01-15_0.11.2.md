Inside the improvements of 0.11.1, a critical bug that seems to affect
release-version windows only sneaked in. This bug causes autonav to basically
crash the game when activated in certain conditions. Given that this makes the
game pretty much unplayable on affected systems, we created a new version that
should solve the issue. Thanks to all those reported and involved in the
fixing!
