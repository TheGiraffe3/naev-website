title: 'Naev 0.10.0-beta.1'
author: bobbens
tags: [ 'release' ]

So it's that time of year again. Although a lot of new features, content, and
mechanics have been added, there has also been significant effort in
modernizing and rewriting large parts of legacy code in an effort to improve
performance overall. As with all major releases, so much has changed that it is
nearly impossible for the release to be bug free and for this purpose we wish
to start doing a series of betas for public testing of the upcoming 0.10.0
release.

If you try it and find any issues, please report them at [the issue
tracker](https://github.com/naev/naev/issues). Discussion about the game can be
had on Discord ([discord invite](https://discord.com/invite/nd2M5BR)).

To get the new version you can:

* Opt-in to the `beta` channel via steam
* [Download the new version from here](https://github.com/naev/naev/releases/tag/v0.10.0-beta.1).
