blurb: Naev 0.11.0-beta.2 is released!
---

During playtesting 0.11.0-beta.1, we've found a bunch of bugs and issues that
we've addressed. In particular, some of the more important ones include having
the slim GUI show what outfits are being activated, which is particularly
useful for toggle weapon sets, and fixed some issues with collisions making it
hard for fast weapons to hit their targets.
As always, please report any issues on [this tracker](https://github.com/naev/naev/issues),
and feel free to join our Discord or Matrix chatrooms. Find out more about them [here!](https://naev.org/contact/)
